    <h2 class="h2">Project Description</h2>
    <p>Our project is titled “I am Something of a Painter Myself,”
      it is a GAN(generative adversarial network) related competition conducted on Kaggle.
      A GAN allows you to imitate the unique color choices and brushstrokes employed by
      renowned artists such as Monet. The goal of this competition is to create a GAN that
      will output images in the style of a Monet to trick classifiers into believing that it is a
      true Monet, not a generated one. The better quality your images can mimic a Monet, the lower
      your MiFID (Memorization-informed Fréchet Inception Distance) and the higher you will move
      up in the leaderboard.
    </p>

    <p>The modeling algorithm used for our project was a specific type of GAN, the cycleGAN. The cycleGAN specializes in
      image-to-image translation which is how we can convert a normal image into one resembling the styles of our
      artists. The cycleGAN consists of a source and target domain. The source domain consists of non-painting images
      and the target domain consists of paintings by the artists. The cycleGAN also consists of two generators and two
      discriminators. One generator’s job is to take images from the source domain and turn them into the target domain.
      The second generator does the opposite of the first domain. The discriminator takes in the real images from the
      target domain and the generated images from the generator to predict if they are real or fake.
